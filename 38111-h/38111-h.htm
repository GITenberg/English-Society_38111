<h2>GEORGE DU MAURIER</h2>


<p>I was thinking, with a pang, just before I put my pen to the paper,
that the death of George du Maurier must be a fact of stale interest to
the reader already, and that it would be staler yet by the time my words
reached him. So swiftly does the revolving world carry our sorrow into
the sun, our mirth into the shade, that it is as if the speed of the planet
had caught something of the impatience of age, and it were hurried round
upon its axis with the quickened pulses of senility. But perhaps this is
a delusion of ours who dwell in the vicissitude of events, and there are
still spots on the earth's whirling surface, lurking-places of quiet, where it
seems not to move, and there is time to remember and to regret; where
it is no astonishing thing that a king should be a whole month dead, and
yet not forgotten. At any rate, it is in the hope, if not quite the faith, of
this that I venture some belated lines concerning a man whom we have
 lost just when he seemed beginning to reveal himself.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>It was my good fortune to have the courage to write to Du Maurier
when <i>Trilby</i> was only half printed, and to tell him how much I liked
the gay, sad story. In every way it was well that I did not wait for the
end, for the last third of it seemed to me so altogether forced in its conclusions
that I could not have offered my praises with a whole heart, nor
he accepted them with any, if the disgust with its preposterous popularity,
which he so frankly, so humorously expressed, had then begun in him.
But the liking which its readers felt had not yet become loathsome to the
author, and he wrote me back a charming note, promising me the mystery,
and enough of it, which I had hoped for, because of my pleasure in
the true-dreaming in <i>Peter Ibbetson</i>; and speaking briefly, most modestly
and fitly, of his commencing novelist at sixty, and his relative misgivings
and surprises.</p>

<p>It was indeed one of the most extraordinary things in the history of
literature, and without a parallel, at least to my ignorance. He might
 have commenced and failed; that would have been infinitely less amazing
than his most amazing success; but it was very amazing that he should
have commenced at all. It is useless to say that he had commenced long
before, and in the literary property of his work he had always been an
author. This theory will not justify itself to any critical judgment; one
might as well say, if some great novelist distinguished for his sense of
color took to painting, that he had always been an artist. The wonder
of Du Maurier's essay, the astounding spectacle of his success, cannot be
diminished by any such explanation of it. He commenced novelist in
<i>Peter Ibbetson</i>, and so far as literature was concerned he succeeded in
even greater fulness than he has succeeded since. He had perfect reason
to be surprised; he had attempted an experiment, and he had performed
a miracle.</p>

<p>As for the nature, or the quality, of his miracle, that is another question.
I myself think that in all essentials it was fine. The result was
not less gold because there was some dross of the transmuted metals hanging
about the precious ingot, and the evidences of the process were present,
though the secret was as occult as ever. He won the heart, he kindled
the fancy, he bewitched the reason; and no one can say just how he did
 it. His literary attitude was not altogether new; he perfected an attitude
recognizable first in Fielding, next in Sterne, then in Heine, afterwards in
Thackeray: the attitude which I once called confidential, and shook three
realms beyond seas, and their colonial dependencies here, with the word.
It is an attitude which I find swaggering in Fielding, insincere in Sterne,
mocking in Heine, and inartistic in Thackeray; but Du Maurier made it
lovable. His whole story was a confidence; whatever illusion there was
resided in that fact; you had to grant it in the beginning, and he made
you grant it gladly. A trick? Yes; but none of your vulgar ones; a
species of legerdemain, exquisite as that of the Eastern juggler who plants
his ladder on the ground, climbs it, and pulls it up after him into the
empty air. It wants seriousness, it wants the last respect for the reader's
intelligence, it wants critical justification; it wants whatever is the very
greatest thing in the very greatest novelists; the thing that convinces in
Hawthorne, George Eliot, Tourgu&eacute;nief, Tolstoy. But short of this supreme
truth, it has every grace, every beauty, every charm. It touches, it
appeals, it consoles; and it flatters, too; if it turns the head, if it intoxicates,
well, it is better to own the fact that it leaves one in not quite the
condition for judging it. I made my tacit protest against it after following
Trilby, poor soul, to her apotheosis at the hands of the world and the
church; but I fell a prey to it again in the first chapters of <i>The Martian</i>,
and I expect to continue in that sweet bondage to the end.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>If I venture to say that sentimentality is the dominant of the Du
Maurier music, it is because his art has made sentimentality beautiful; I
had almost said real, and I am ready to say different from what it was
before. It is a very manly sentimentality; we need not be ashamed of
sharing it; one should rather be ashamed of disowning its emotions. It
is in its sweetness, as well as its manliness, that I find the chief analogy
between Du Maurier's literature and his art. In all the long course of
his dealing with the life of English society, I can think of but two or
three instances of ungentleness. The humor which shone upon every rank,
and every variety of character, never abashed the lowly, never insulted
women, never betrayed the trust which reposed in its traditions of decency
and generosity. If we think of any other caricaturist's art, how bitter it
is apt to be, how brutal, how base! The cruelties that often pass for wit,
even in the best of our own society satires, never tempted him to their
ignoble exploitation; and as for the filthy drolleries of French wit, forever
amusing itself with one commandment, how far they all are from him!
His pictures are full of the dearest children, lovely young girls, honest
young fellows; snobs who are as compassionable as they are despicable,
bores who have their reason for being, hypocrites who are not beyond
redemption. It is in his tolerance, his final pity of all life, that Du
Maurier takes his place with the great talents; and it is in his sympathy
for weakness, for the abased and outcast, that he classes himself with the
foremost novelists of the age, not one of whom is recreant to the high
office of teaching by parable that we may not profitably despise one
another. Not even Svengali was beyond the pale of his mercy, and how
well within it some other sorts of sinners were, the grief of very respectable
people testified.</p>

<p>I will own myself that I like heroes and heroines to be born in wedlock
when they conveniently can, and to keep true to it; but if an author
wishes to suppose them otherwise I cannot proscribe them except for subsequent
misbehavior in his hands. The trouble with Trilby was not that
she was what she was imagined, but that finally the world could not
imaginably act with regard to her as the author feigned. Such as she are
to be forgiven, when they sin no more; not exalted and bowed down to
by all manner of elect personages. But I fancy Du Maurier did not
mean her to be an example. She had to be done something with, and
after all she had suffered, it was not in the heart of poetic justice to deny
her a little moriturary triumph.</p>

<p>Du Maurier was not a censor of morals, but of manners, which
indeed are or ought to be the flower of morals, but not their root, and his
deflections from the straight line in the destiny of his creations must not
be too seriously regarded. I take it that the very highest fiction is that
which treats itself as fact, and never once allows itself to be otherwise.
This is the kind that the reader may well hold to the strictest accountability
in all respects. But there is another kind capable of expressing an
engaging beauty, and bewitchingly portraying many phases of life, which
comes smiling to you or (in vulgar keeping) nudging you, and asking you
to a game of make-believe. I do not object to that kind either, but I
should not judge it on such high grounds as the other. I think it reached
its perfect effect in Du Maurier's hands, and that this novelist, who wrote
no fiction till nigh sixty, is the greatest master in that sort who ever lived,
and I do not forget either Sterne or Thackeray when I say so. </p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>When I first spoke, long ago, of the confidential attitude of Thackeray,
I said that now we would not endure it. But I was wrong, if I
meant that more than the very small number who judge novels critically
would be impatient of it. No sooner were those fearful words printed
than I began to find, to my vast surprise, that the confidential attitude in
Thackeray was what most pleased the greatest number of his readers.
This gave me an ill opinion of their taste, but I could not deny the fact;
and the obstreperous triumph of <i>Trilby</i>, which was one long confidence, has
since contributed to render my defeat overwhelming. Du Maurier's use of
the method, as he perfected it, was so charming that I am not sure but I
began to be a little in love with it myself, though ordinarily superior to its
blandishments. It was all very well to have Thackeray weep upon your
neck over the fortunes of his characters, but if he had just been telling
you they were puppets, it was not so gratifying; and as for poor Sterne,
his sighs were so frankly insincere you could not believe anything he said.
But Du Maurier came with another eye for life, with a faith of his own
which you could share, and with a spirit which endeared him from the
first. He had prodigious novelties in store: true-dreaming, hypnotism, and
now (one does not know quite what yet) intelligence from the neighborly
little planet Mars. He had the gift of persuading you that all his
wonders were true, and his flattering familiarity of manner heightened the
effect of his wonders, like that of the prestidigitator, who passes round in
his audience, chatting pleasantly, while he pours twenty different liquors
out of one magical bottle.</p>

<p>I would not count his beautiful talent at less than its rare worth,
and if this figure belittles that, it does him wrong. Not before in our
literature has anything more distinct, more individual, made itself felt. I
have assumed to trace its descent, from this writer to that; but it was
only partly so descended; in what made it surprising and captivating, it
was heaven-descended. We shall be the lonelier and the poorer hereafter
for the silence which is to be where George du Maurier might have been.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
